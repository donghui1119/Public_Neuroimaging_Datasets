# Public Neuroimaging Datasets


## HCP Healthy Adult

https://www.humanconnectome.org/study/hcp-young-adult

The Human Connectome Project (HCP) has tackled key aspects of this challenge by charting the neural pathways that underlie brain function and behavior, including high-quality neuroimaging data in over 1100 healthy young adults. 


## HCP development

https://www.humanconnectome.org/study/hcp-lifespan-development

Childhood and adolescence are times of dramatic physical, emotional, social, and intellectual growth and change. Yet there is much we do not know about how normal development and childhood experiences (learning to read, playing a sport, or interacting socially) shape the brain’s wiring.



## HCP aging

https://www.humanconnectome.org/study/hcp-lifespan-aging


Changes in brain structure and function are a normal part of the aging process from middle age through older adulthood. In the last decade, an explosion of work has focused on brain structure in disorders that occur as we age. Yet, relatively few studies have focused on healthy aging of brain circuitry and how it varies across people. 


## HCP Baby

https://www.humanconnectome.org/study/lifespan-baby-connectome-project

The LifeSpan Baby Connectome Project (BCP) will explore human brain development from birth through early childhood, focusing on factors that contribute to healthy brain development.


## Lifespan Developing Human Connectome Project

https://www.humanconnectome.org/study/lifespan-developing-human-connectome-project

The Developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP), led by King’s College London, Imperial College London and Oxford University, aims to make major scientific progress by creating the first 4-dimensional connectome of early life. Our goal is to create a dynamic map of human brain connectivity from 20 to 44 weeks post-conceptional age, which will link together imaging, clinical, behavioural, and genetic information. This unique setting, with imaging and collateral data in an expandable open-source informatics structure, will permit wide use by the scientific community, and to undertake pioneer studies into normal and abnormal development by studying well-phenotyped and genotyped group of infants with specific genetic and environmental risks that could lead to Autistic Spectrum Disorder or Cerebral Palsy.


## Alzheimer's Disease Connectome Project

https://www.humanconnectome.org/study/alzheimers-disease-connectome-project

## Changes in Visual Cortical Connectivity Following Central Visual Field Loss

https://www.humanconnectome.org/study/changes-visual-cortical-connectivity-following-central-visual-field-loss

People who have macular degeneration often lose the ability to see in the part of vision normally used for daily tasks such as reading and recognizing faces. This often debilitating loss is expected to afflict 3 million US citizens by 2020. An essential health-related goal is therefore to develop strategies that allow patients with macular degeneration to make better use of their spared peripheral vision. Despite loss of central vision, many patients learn to successfully navigate the world, becoming adept at using peripheral vision for tasks normally done with central vision.


## Connectomes Related to Anxiety & Depression


https://www.humanconnectome.org/study/connectomes-related-anxiety-depression

The Connectomes Related to Anxiety and Depression in Adolescents Project is a collaborative effort among researchers at the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), McLean Hospital, and Boston University. We will focus on understanding psychiatric disorders in adolescence, in particular those associated with two leading causes of death in adolescents and young adults (suicide and substance-abuse related accidents). Our research is guided by the “Acute Threat/Fear” and the “Reward/Prediction Error” construct.


## Connectomic Imaging in Familial & Sporadic Frontotemporal Degeneration

https://www.humanconnectome.org/study/connectomic-imaging-familial-sporadic-frontotemporal-degeneration

Frontotemporal Dementia Connectomics (FTDConn) - Neurodegenerative disease is a major public health problem. Frontotemporal degeneration (FTD) is a clinical neurodegenerative condition that affects both gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) and causes a network disorder. 


## HCP 7T 

https://www.humanconnectome.org/study/hcp-young-adult/article/reprocessed-7t-fmri-data-released-other-updates

## myconnectome

http://myconnectome.org/wp/

The MyConnectome project has characterized how the brain of one person changes over the course of more than one year.  It is almost certainly the most ambitious study of a single living person’s brain ever attempted. The data will provide new insights into the dynamics of brain activity and their relationship to bodily metabolism and psychological function.  The project is also openly sharing a large amount of biological data for future reuse.

The human brain processes vast amounts of diverse input that are continuously gathered across the senses. However, most experiments study the brain via simplified stimuli that do little to resemble the complexity of a natural environment — a mismatch that must be addressed if we are to better understand how the brain works.

A number of online neuroscience databases are available which provide information regarding gene expression, neurons, macroscopic brain structure, and neurological or psychiatric disorders. Some databases contain descriptive and numerical data, some to brain function, others offer access to 'raw' imaging data, such as postmortem brain sections or 3D MRI and fMRI images. Some focus on the human brain, others on non-human.
